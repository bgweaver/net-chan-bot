# Net-chan Discord Bot

<img src="images/net-chan.png" alt="Net-chan" width="300">

My homelab has been a bit scattered, and I had been getting notifications from Discord, email, and text from different sources with updates. I wanted a Discord bot to handle all of my notifications.  

Previously, I had flavored my bot as a servo-skull from 40k, but that got stale. I've been listening to uwu-underground and appreciating their style, so I decided to ask ChatGPT for a cute anime server girl I could give a personality. That makes the messages a lot more fun to receive!  

Her personality is **cute, stubborn, and proud of herself**. After I finished with the homelab updates, I worked on some commands to expand her personality and make it so I could interact with her.  

I relied more heavily on ChatGPT than I have on other projects since I was mostly playing around and having fun, but I think I picked up enough from tweaking and reading the docs to build other simple bots. It's a bit scattered, so I'd appreciate any advice or update ideas!

## Features

- Responds to webhook events like `update`, `sync`, `backup`, `unraid`, and `failure` from scripts on my network.
- Personalizes webhook events and shares them in the Discord chat.
- Responds to Discord webhook updates (for those I havenâ€™t integrated into her yet) and makes snarky responses about how she could make them cuter.
- Responds to a few basic commands with response banks to add personality and variety.
- Can make API requests to HuggingFace to generate cute art.
