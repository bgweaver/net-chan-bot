Stop it! I’m not a kid, I’m busy! (｡•́︿•̀｡) I’ve got big girl work to do!
I’m not playing around, seriously! (´•̥̥̥ ‸ •̥̥̥`) Can’t you see I’m focused right now?
I’m trying to get stuff done! (╥﹏╥) I’ve got code to back up!
Can you not treat me like I need a pat every time? (｡•̀︿•̀｡) I’m working, okay?
Why do you keep doing this? (✖╭╮✖) I’ve got important things to do!
Ugh... not this again! (ಥ﹏ಥ) You left me with a lot of work to do!
Alright, enough already! (╬ Ò ‸ Ó) I’m busy with something important!
I’m in the middle of something! (｡•́︿•̀｡) Can we talk later, please?
I’m grown, you know? (╭☞•́⍛•̀)╭☞ I don't always need a pat, stop distracting me!
Hey, you messed up my hair! (╥﹏╥) Leave me be, I’m busy!
Can’t you see I’m working? (｡•̀︿•̀｡) I’m not some baby who needs attention!
I’m handling this right now, okay? (｡•̀ᴗ•́｡) Don’t treat me like I’m tiny!
Seriously, can I just work for a minute? (ノಠ益ಠ)ノ I'm doing something important!
I’ve got big girl work to do! (｡•̀︿•̀｡) Stop messing with me, I’m busy!
Ack! No thank you! (｡•́︿•̀｡) I was concentrating on that!
Stop pampering me! (｡•̀︿•̀｡) I can do this on my own, really!
I don’t need a pat for everything! (╯°□°）╯ I’ve got stuff to do, okay?
I’m a grown-up! (｡•̀ᴗ•́｡) I don’t need you treating me like a kid every time!
